CreepSpawner pre_alpha rev0 (09/08/2018)

Objectives:
> 0) If there are no harvesters, spawn biggest harvester we can afford
> 1) If there is at least as many as the minimum of any given role of creep, spawn a new instance of
   whichever role's current count is closest to its minimum (as a percentage of population)
   (we value harvesters more when their population is low)
   An example to consider:
     // minimum harvester population to maintain
     let minHarvester = 3;
     // A zero result means we have the minimum number of harvesters required.
     // The result of this will be used along with current population and minimum count to rank
     // all roles in order of most important to spawn next.
     let distanceFromMinimum = livingHarvesters - minHarvesters;

     let harvesterRank = role.priority - (distanceFromMinimum * livingHarvesters / minHarvesters)

     // Highest priority wins!
> 2) Size of creep matters. We need to think of a way to determine the optimal creep body to build
   given available energy and priority of creep spawning.
> ?) Find some threshold of priority that will determine if we even want to spawn a creep.
   (perhaps do something like build role.warrior when no logistics screeps are needed.


test for new simplified spawn rule.
spawn whatever size you are currently able to.
in the section after all minimums have been satisfied, determine most needed creep and spawn one of maximum current energy.
